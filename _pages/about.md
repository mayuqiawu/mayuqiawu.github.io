About me
======
Welcome to my homepage! 

I am currently an Assistant Professor in School of Mathematical Sciences, Shenzhen University. Prior to this, I got my PhD degree from Department of Applied Mathematics of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaoqi Yang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/profile/xqyang/). I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics at South China University of Technology in 2018, where I spent two years as a master student under the supervision of Prof. Shaohua Pan. Without getting a master degree, I went to the Hong Kong Polytechnic University to persue a PhD degree in Sept. 2020.

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie in optimization algorithms. Currently, I have been working on designing second-order methods for solving problems involved in sparse optimization.
